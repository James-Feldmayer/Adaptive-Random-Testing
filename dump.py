# I believe the error that was occuring was that I was that when I evaluate

# The function is not neccessarily from the textfile specified

# Is there some safer way to evaluate user code?


# I want to left align the error labels (very last gui update)
# Then add the sumart stuff
# How should the user navigate through the test case failures and what not?


# Need to hook up the gui
# How long will this take?
# Should I put the other half in a different file?
# How can I make my code as modular and

# 3. bring functionality from gui.py to basic.py
# 4. 2 text boxes, success and failure

# finally
# combine test3.py, basic.py and gui.py

# basic.py: new gui
# test3.py: more robust

# gui.py: timing and threads bullshit
# adhoc but only currently working solution
